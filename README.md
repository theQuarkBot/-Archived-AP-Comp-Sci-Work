# APCompSciProjects
Some of the projects that I did in my AP Computer Science A class (don't judge).

Also, I don't really care what you do with these (cheat away!) but I would appreciate it if you did not edit them... this serves as a sort of time capsule for me. One day, I'll come back to see how god-awful I was at coding.
